# Text-to-Binary and Binary-to-Text Converter

This is a Python script that allows you to convert text to binary and binary back to text.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/TextToBinaryAndBinaryToText.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd TextToBinaryAndBinaryToText
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python converter.py
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to either convert text to binary or binary to text.

## How it works

- `text_to_binary`: Converts each character of the input text into its ASCII binary representation.

- `binary_to_text`: Converts a binary string back to text.
